Facebook doesn't give every person the same version of code that displays the site. They do this for various reasons, such as testing new features on just some users before rolling them out to everyone.
Because of this, what works for me, may not work for you. Since I am only able to work with what Facebook gives me personally, there is no way for me to investigate other users' issues that aren't also present for me.
It's possible that if you wait for a little while, I might start getting the same version as you, and will be able to fix the problem on my own. Otherwise, the only way to find the solution is if you do so yourself.

Ads are blocked based with an explicit list of CSS selectors, nothing fancy or automatic.
If ads are showing for you, first follow the wiki guide [HERE](https://github.com/mgziminsky/FacebookTrackingRemoval/wiki/How-to-identify-selector-for-ads-not-being-blocked).

If you are unable to identify a working selector after following the guide, or have questions about something in the guide, you may ask them here.

If you attempted to follow the guide, please provide the CSS selectors you tested and the result of trying each one with your question.
